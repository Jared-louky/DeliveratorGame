Title: The Deliverator   
Created: Fall 2020  
Built in Mac OS using Python 3 




Deliverator is my Python code Louisville project using Python. Drawing inspiration from the 1992 book 
"Snow Crash" by Neal Stephenson.  The Game sets the player in a dystopian alternate reality where they 
are appling to be a delivery driver for CosaNostra Pizza, a company run by a large mafia conglomerate. 

Success or failure is dependant on the players ability to quickly determine whether or not they can complete 
a delivery within the artifical timespan of 30 minutes, just like in the book.  The player will choose whether or not the delivery can be accomplished in the tiem alloted If they choose the delivery and it is executed in said time they are rewarded with credits. If they player acheives the minimum threshold of credits, they will be hired by CosaNostra, if the fail to make a delivery within 30 minute or fail to meet the credit threshold within the time, the game will end.  

The user will need to run game_ply.py in thier command shell 

The project will fulfill these requirements needeed to pass the Code Louisville Python class

* A "While Loop" allows the player to restart the game upon failure

* Create and call at least 3 functions.  Nearly all the functions for the game are located in the deliveries.py file and are imported onto the game_play.py

* 


The game in it current form is a very simple one, additional features can and will be added as I expand my Python knowledge.
